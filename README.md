# virtual-courier
This project supports a Slack application used by the Collections & Loans department of an art museum. When the application is added to a private channel, it generates a CSV and PDF of the channel history and sends the files to the channel. 
# Setup
- Install the virtual-courier package.
- Install dependencies shown in requirements.txt.
- Ensure that the __Virtual Courier Archive__ application has been installed in the Slack workspace.
- In the virtual-courier folder, create a file called .env to hold the tokens used to connect to Slack.
  ```
  VC_CONNECT_TOKEN="xapp-XXXXXXX"
  VC_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-XXXXXXX"
  ```
